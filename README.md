# Unexpected Behavior of `head` Command with Large Files in Bash

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the `head` command in bash when processing extremely large files.  The `head` command might not always return the expected number of lines, leading to unexpected program behavior.

## Problem
The `head -n` command in bash, while generally reliable, can exhibit unpredictable behavior when dealing with exceptionally large files (hundreds of millions or billions of lines).  Factors such as buffer size limits or how the command processes certain newline characters might interfere.

This issue is especially critical in applications that rely on `head` for data sampling or processing limited portions of large log files or datasets.

## Solution
Using `awk` is a safer and more reliable method to get a specific number of lines from a file, regardless of its size.  `awk` is better at handling large files and various line ending styles. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.sh`.
3. Observe the output. It should print a warning that the `head` command failed to return the correct number of lines.
4. Run `bugSolution.sh` to observe the solution using `awk`. 

This example highlights the importance of considering potential issues when working with large files and choosing the right tools for the job.
